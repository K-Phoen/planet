    Binary code analysis is required when you only have access to program's binary
    code, or when you do not trust the compile chain that you use. In the last two
    decades, this field has made big progress but, still, it remains confidential
    and most of the people will just consider it as classical program analysis. In
    fact, binary analysis induces a lot of practical and theoritical problems which
    are specific to binary code analysis.

    I will present the context of binary analysis and develop the specific problems
    that are linked to this topic (dynamic jumps, loop unwinding, self-modifying
    code, ...). Then, I will introduce our intermediate representation (microcode)
    and explain our main algorithm to rebuild the control flow of a binary program.
